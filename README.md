# Game Show Buzzer System

The idea of this project is to create a buzzer system similar to those seen on game shows like *Jeopardy!* or quiz bowls. These are usually called "lockout" buzzer systems, probably since the first person to buzz in causes everyone else to be "locked out" from buzzing in, too.

**This project is a work-in-progress.**

## To Do:
- [X] Detect button input
- [X] Implement debouncing
- [X] Implement "lockout" functionality described above (with an additional button to reset everything)
- [ ] Add LEDs - one for each player - to light up with the corresponding button that was pressed first (maybe add a buzzer, too)
- [ ] Finalize all hardware components and move them from a breadboard to a perfboard (maybe use an Arduino Nano, too)
- [ ] 3D print a housing for each button and a case for the perfboard and Arduino, use cables to connect each button to the case (maybe old telephone cable)
- [ ] Assemble everything!
